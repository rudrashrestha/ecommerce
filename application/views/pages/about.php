to new products which they might be interested in. As new products are offered to existing software downloaders,   7Install<br>
gives advertisers access to a broader, targeted customer base – a large percentage of who are bound to take advantage of <br>
what they have to offer. This open market concept drives thousands of software installations on a daily basis while <br>

More importantly, we have our very own software network. Our aim is to generate an entirely new customer base for our <br>
advertisers, while increasing the profit from the distribution of their software at the same time. The thrust of our campaign <br>
lies in offering several free software titles – then bundling them up with matching offers from publishers. We are proud<br>

<br>
No matter which kind of software it is that publishers offer,   7Installassures that their existence will be brought to the <br>
attention of customers. All the software applications in our unique marketplace are screened and tested before they <br>
get offered to even one customer. We also have a state-of-the-art installer which is designed to find the best possible <br>
